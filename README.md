Online slicer for my Anycubic Photon Mono 4K

You might need to grab the printer config file from the uvtools GitHub and put it in `.config/PrusaSlicer/printer/` - https://github.com/sn4k3/UVtools/blob/master/PrusaSlicer/printer/AnyCubic%20Photon%20Mono%204K.ini

You also might need to change the first argument of `uvtools_cmd` to match your executable, e.g. `UVtools.AppImage`

You're a cool dude, you'll figure it out
